Model provenance asks a deceptively simple question: *where did this artifact come from?* For a trained model, the answer may involve training data, checkpoints, fine-tuning runs, tool calls, and deployment configuration. A useful account therefore needs more than a single hash.

## Provenance as a chain

A provenance record can be treated as a sequence of transformations. If an artifact $A_0$ becomes $A_n$ through transformations $T_1, \ldots, T_n$, then:

$$
A_n = T_n(T_{n-1}(\cdots T_1(A_0)))
$$

The equation is compact; the evidence is not. Each transformation should identify its inputs, parameters, environment, and responsible actor.

### Minimal fields

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Artifact identifier | Names the object being described |
| Parent reference | Connects one state to the previous state |
| Transformation | Records what changed |
| Evidence | Supports later verification |

## Verification boundaries

Provenance is not the same as truth. A signed record can show that a claim was preserved without proving that the original claim was accurate. Systems should make that boundary explicit.[^boundary]

```ts
type ProvenanceEvent = {
  artifact: string;
  parent?: string;
  operation: string;
  recordedAt: string;
};
```

## Practical direction

Start with the decisions a later reviewer must reconstruct. Collect only the evidence needed to answer those questions, and state where the chain becomes incomplete.
